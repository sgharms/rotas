# Rotas

A library for implementing a 4 wheel remory palace based on the
techniques described by Giodarno Bruno in _DE UMBRIS IDEARUM_.

## Technique

Bruno proposes a series of concentric rings where the intersection of a
token on the outer, can be combined with a token on the inner, with a
token on the inner up to an unimaginable number of rings or wheels
(Latin: _rotas_).

So by memorizing 4 rings of tokens which correspond to the alphabet one
can gain 26<sup>4</sup> unique intersections.  While memorizing such a
huge number may seem daunting, if you can memorize 26 small stories e.g.
<subject> <verb> <implement> <location> you can gain that number with
very little difficulty.

`rotas` helps you build those sentences from your wheels.

## Example

The French word "fleur" corresponds to "flower" in English.  To memorize
this association, `rotas` helps you generate this short story.

    ➜  rotas git:(master) ✗ rotas "fleur/flower"
    [Frank Sinatra] [snorts cocaine] with a [golf club] in/on a [tokyo!!!].
    [Regina Spektor] /[shoots heroin] with a [straw] in/on a [garbage can].
    [Winston Churchill] [plays golf] with a [drumstick].


From these genearted stories I would remember "Ol Blue eyes is doing
coke and raging with a golden golf club in a Tokyo bar, scaring the crap
out of admiring patrons and Regina Spektor; this is a sad continuation
of behavior where he was snoring cocaine with a giant megaphone outside
lovely old London where Ed Norton was doing an experimental gig drumming
on chairs."

F subject = *F*rank Sinatra
L verb = *L*indsay Lohan
E object = *E*d Norton's in "Fight Club" golf club
U location = *U*ltraman's location, tokyo!
R subject = *R*egina Spektor

F subject = *F*rank Sinatra
L verb = *L*indsay Lohan
O object = *O*scar the Grouch's implement for shouting
W location = *W*inston Churchill
E subject = *E*d Norton
R verb = Drumming on a chair done by *R*egina Spektor at her show

**NOTE**:  The stories generated by `rotas` are **FICTIONAL**.  They are
plot ideas and are not slanders of the famous person or actor who might
**PLAY** them.
